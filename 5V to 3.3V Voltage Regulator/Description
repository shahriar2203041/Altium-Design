Thrilled to share my latest PCB design project — a 5V to 3.3V Voltage Regulator, fully designed using Altium Designer! 🛠️🔋
This board steps down a 5V input to a stable 3.3V output using the MIC5317 LDO Regulator — perfect for powering low-voltage embedded devices like ESP32, STM32, and other 3.3V logic systems.
(Designed as part of an assignment by Embedded Innovators KUET.)

🔧 What I worked on:
• Designed the schematic and PCB layout in Altium
• Integrated SM02B-GHS-TB(LF)(SN) connectors for easy system integration
• Simulated and visualized the board in 3D
• Focused on clean routing and compact component placement

💡 Skills practiced:
